# Devlog: Remove Real-time Lint Feature and Add Debug Mode

**Task/Story**: Remove Real-time Lint Feature and Add Debug Mode
**Date**: 2025-05-27
**Author**: Gemini
**Version PRD**: N/A
**Story PRD**: N/A

## 1. Summary
This development session primarily completed two tasks:
1.  Removed the real-time linting feature from the front-end Monaco Editor, as it only supported JavaScript and was not effective. The related perception and guidance logic were also cleaned up, but the infrastructure for user behavior perception (idle, frequent editing) was retained.
2.  Added a debug mode control feature to the front-end UI, allowing the display of three debug components (Guidance Debug, Error State Debug, Perception Status) to be independently controlled via environment variables, and created corresponding documentation for it.

## 2. Files Changed/Added
*   `codewave/frontend/mvp-app/src/App.tsx` (Modified - Removed `hasLintErrors` reference, added debug mode control logic)
*   `codewave/frontend/mvp-app/src/features/perception/usePerception.ts` (Modified - Removed lint detection logic, retained idle and frequent editing)
*   `codewave/frontend/mvp-app/src/features/perception/types.ts` (Modified - Updated `PerceptionState`, removed lint-related properties)
*   `codewave/frontend/mvp-app/src/features/guidance/useGuidance.ts` (Modified - Removed `lintError` guidance logic)
*   `codewave/frontend/mvp-app/src/features/guidance/types.ts` (Modified - Updated `GuidanceType` and `UseGuidanceProps`, removed lint-related types)
*   `codewave/frontend/mvp-app/src/utils/debugConfig.ts` (Added - Implemented debug mode configuration utility)
*   `codewave/frontend/mvp-app/DEBUG_FEATURES.md` (Added - Created debug feature documentation)

## 3. Key Technical Decisions
*   **Retain Partial Perception Functionality**: Decided not to completely remove the perception module, but only the parts related to Monaco's real-time linting (`hasLintErrors`, `markers`). The detection logic for `isIdle` and `isFrequentEditing` was kept to provide a foundation for future user behavior analysis or more intelligent guidance.
*   **Environment Variable Controlled Debug Mode**: Used Vite's environment variables (`import.meta.env.VITE_*`) combined with `import.meta.env.DEV` to control the display of the debug UI. This ensures that the debug features are only active in development mode and that each debug component can be toggled independently.
*   **No Backend Guidance Modification**: Confirmed that `useRuntimeGuidance` handles error guidance for backend execution results and is unrelated to front-end real-time linting, so it was left unchanged.

## 4. Main Challenges and Solutions
*   **Accurately Identifying Cleanup Scope**: Initially, the understanding of the "lint" feature was not clear, which almost led to the accidental deletion of guidance related to backend error handling. By communicating with the user and carefully analyzing the code, the scope of cleanup was clarified to be limited to the front-end Monaco Editor's real-time linting.
*   **ESLint `any` Type Warning**: When modifying `usePerception.ts`, the removal of some Monaco type imports caused some variables to be inferred as `any`. By consulting Monaco's documentation and the code context, a more accurate type, `{ dispose: () => void } | null`, was provided for `contentChangeListenerDisposable` and `cursorChangeListenerDisposable`.
*   **Vite Environment Variable Import Issue**: When adding debug mode controls in App.tsx, an editor auto-import issue caused `shouldShowGuidanceDebug` to not be imported correctly, leading to a type error. The problem was resolved by manually checking and correcting the import statement.

## 5. Testing Summary
*   **Manual Testing**:
    *   Verified that after removing real-time linting, the editor no longer shows real-time error markers.
    *   Verified that the original idle and frequent editing behavior perception prompts (enabled via debug mode) still work as expected.
    *   By setting different environment variables, verified that the three debug UI components (Guidance Debug, Error State Debug, Perception Status) can be independently controlled for display and hiding.
    *   Verified that in production mode (via `npm run build` and `npm run preview`), the debug UI does not appear even if the debug environment variables are set.
*   **Unit Tests**: No new or modified unit tests.
*   **Code Quality**:
    *   ESLint check passed (for modified and new files).
    *   TypeScript type check (`npm run type-check`) passed.
    *   Code formatting conforms to project standards.

## 6. Technical Debt Management
*   **`tooling-editor-debt.md`**:
    *   **Enhance Monaco Linting**: The removal of the basic linting feature in this session makes this technical debt item more explicit. If front-end linting is needed in the future, integrating a more powerful Linter or Language Server should be considered. This item will be marked as related to this change.

## 7. Lessons Learned / Reflection
*   **Clarify Requirement Boundaries**: When performing cleanup or refactoring tasks, it is crucial to communicate fully with the requester to ensure a clear and consistent understanding of the requirement boundaries and goals, avoiding accidental deletions or excessive modifications.
*   **Vite Environment Variables**: Familiarity with how Vite handles environment variables (`import.meta.env.VITE_*` and `import.meta.env.DEV`) is very important for implementing differentiated functionality between development and production environments.
*   **Incremental Verification**: When modifying multiple files, making small commits and verifications (like type checking, lint checking) helps to discover problems early and reduce debugging complexity.

## 8. Process Improvements Implemented
*   None

## 9. Next Steps / Follow-up
*   Await user confirmation of the development results.
*   Make potential adjustments based on user feedback.
