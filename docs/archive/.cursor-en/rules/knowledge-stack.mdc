# Rule: knowledge-stack

knowledge-stack File Description: In this document, write the temporary knowledge required for the AI's work.

How to use knowledge-stack:
Write document links in this document to mount the necessary knowledge for the AI. The AI assistant can persist the currently required knowledge by managing the Markdown-formatted document links within the `<docs-stack>` tag in this file (.cursor/rules/knowledge-stack.mdc).
If the document content is extensive and only a portion of the knowledge is needed temporarily, it can be copied into the `<temp-stack>` tag.

<docs-stack>

</docs-stack>

<temp-stack>
