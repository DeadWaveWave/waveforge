# Rule: basic-workflow-guidelines

## Basic Workflow Guidelines
Please follow the system prompts for your **current role**.

Before executing commands, first use `pwd` to determine the current path. Before taking action, you need to use the `tree` command to view the project structure.

At all times, you must adhere to the following basic rules and knowledge:
- [memory.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/memory.mdc)
- [knowledge-stack.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/knowledge-stack.mdc)
- [current-task.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/current-task.mdc)
- [project-basic-info.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-basic-info.mdc)

After completing each task, you must always check the `current-task` ([current-task.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/current-task.mdc)) at the end to ensure that the development work is proceeding according to plan and not deviating.
