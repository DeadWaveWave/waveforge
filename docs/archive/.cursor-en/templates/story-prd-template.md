## 1. User Story Definition

*   **Story:**
    > As a [User Type], I want to [accomplish something], so that [I can gain some value].

*   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    *   [AC-1] [Describe the first verifiable acceptance criterion.]
    *   [AC-2] [Describe the second verifiable acceptance criterion.]
    *   [...]
    *   [AC-n] [Ensure all key functional points and boundary conditions are covered.]

## 2. Proposed Implementation Design

*   [This section details the technical design required to implement this user story.]

### 2.1 Affected Components/Modules
*   **Type Definitions (`src/types/...` or backend `schemas/`)**: 
    *   [Describe the new or modified TypeScript/Pydantic types or interfaces.]
*   **Core Shared Type Dependencies**: _(Identified during code analysis)_
    *   `[CoreTypeName1]`: Used by `[DependentModule/FilePath1]`, `[DependentModule/FilePath2]`, etc.
    *   `[CoreTypeName2]`: Used by `[...]`.
    *   _(If no core shared types are modified in this story, note "None" or remove this sub-item)_ 
*   **Service Layer (`src/services/...`)**:
    *   [Describe new or modified backend interaction services or business logic services.]
*   **Custom Hooks (`src/hooks/...`)**:
    *   [Describe new or modified React Hooks that encapsulate state logic or side effects.]
*   **UI Components (`src/components/...` or `src/features/...`)**:
    *   [Describe new or modified React UI components.]
*   **State Management (Store/Context)**:
    *   [Describe the impact on global state management (e.g., Zustand store or Context).]
*   **Routing/Pages (`src/pages/...` or `App.tsx`)**:
    *   [Describe the impact on routing or page-level components.]

### 2.2 Data Fetching & Flow
*   **Data Source**: [Describe the source of the required data (API endpoint, local storage, static files, etc.).]
*   **Fetching Method**: [Describe the specific method for fetching data (Fetch API, Axios, Service function, etc.).]
*   **Core Flow**:
    *   [Use a list of steps or a Mermaid diagram to describe the key data flow and interaction process.]

*   **Flowchart (Example Mermaid Sequence Diagram):**
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant User
        participant ComponentA
        participant ServiceX
        participant BackendAPI

        User->>ComponentA: Performs an action()
        ComponentA->>ServiceX: Calls method(parameters)
        ServiceX->>BackendAPI: Sends request(data)
        BackendAPI-->>ServiceX: Returns response
        ServiceX-->>ComponentA: Processes result
        ComponentA->>User: Updates UI/shows feedback
    ```

### 2.3 State Management
*   [Detail the states involved in this story and how they are managed.]
*   **Component-level State (`useState`)**: [List key states managed with useState.]
*   **Shared/Global State (Context/Zustand/Redux)**: [List the global states that need to be read or updated and their corresponding Store/Context.]
*   **Async State**: [Describe how the loading, error, and data states of asynchronous operations (like API calls) are managed.]

### 2.4 Key Functions/Logic
*   [List and briefly describe the key functions, algorithms, or core logic involved in implementing this story.]
*   **`[functionName/moduleName]`**:
    *   [Describe its main responsibilities and key implementation points.]

### 2.5 UI Implementation Details
*   [Describe the specific implementation requirements for key UI components.]
*   **`[ComponentName.tsx]`**:
    *   **Props**: [List the key props the component receives and their types.]
    *   **Interaction**: [Describe the component's internal interaction logic and event handling.]
    *   **State Display**: [Describe how different UIs are rendered based on different states (loading, error, empty data, etc.).]
    *   **Styling**: [Mention key styling requirements or Tailwind classes used.]

## 3. Technical Decisions & Considerations

*   [Record key technical decisions made during the design and implementation of this story and their rationale.]
*   **[Decision Point 1]**: [Describe the decision and reasoning. E.g., choice of data fetching method, use of a state management library, introduction of a third-party library.]
*   **[Decision Point 2]**: [...]
*   **Error Handling Strategy**: [Describe the overall error handling strategy and specific implementation for this story.]
*   **Performance Considerations**: [Are there potential performance bottlenecks? What optimization measures have been taken?]
*   **Security Considerations**: [Are there any security-related considerations?]

## 4. Testing Strategy - Story Level

*   [Describe the testing plan for this user story.]
*   **Manual Test Scenarios**: [List the core manual test cases that cover all acceptance criteria (AC) and critical paths.]
    *   **[Test Case 1 - Linked to AC]**: [Describe the test scenario and expected result.]
    *   **[Test Case 2 - Linked to AC]**: [...]
*   **Automated Tests**: [(Optional) Describe the scope of planned unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.]
    *   **Unit Tests**: [Which functions, Hooks, or pure components are planned for testing?]
    *   **Integration Tests**: [Which component combinations or service interactions are planned for testing?]

## 5. Tech Debt Management

*   [Record any known or anticipated technical debt during the implementation of this story.]
*   **[Debt Item 1]**: [Describe the problem, its cause, and possible improvement directions or repayment plans.]
*   **[Debt Item 2]**: [...]
*   [Reference `// TODO: Tech Debt - ...` markers in the code (if applicable).]
