## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of This Document
This document defines the core architectural principles, design patterns, and development standards for the [Project Name] application/system. It aims to ensure code consistency, maintainability, testability, and extensibility, providing a unified development standard for all team members (including AI collaborators) to reduce communication overhead, improve development efficiency, and enhance product quality.

### 1.2 [Optional] Project Overview / Tech Stack Overview
[Briefly introduce the project's goals (can reference the Version PRD), core features, and the main technology stack used, providing context for the subsequent guidelines. e.g., This project is an AI-powered learning companion prototype using a React frontend and a FastAPI backend...]

## 2. Common Guidelines
[This section contains principles and standards applicable to all parts of the project or across the frontend and backend.]

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture Principles
[Define the fundamental principles guiding the overall project architecture.]
*   **Architectural Goals**: [Define and prioritize architectural goals based on the project phase (e.g., MVP, mature) and Version PRD objectives. How to balance rapid iteration with long-term maintenance?]
    *   **Simplicity & Readability**: [e.g., Code should be easy to understand; prefer simple and direct implementations.]
    *   **Consistency**: [e.g., Follow the standards defined in this document; use code style tools to ensure uniformity.]
    *   **Testability**: [e.g., Architectural design should support unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. How to achieve decoupling?]
    *   **Maintainability**: [e.g., Clear module division, separation of concerns, documentation. How to reduce modification costs?]
    *   **Scalability/Extensibility**: [e.g., Modular design, interface reservations, adapting to future needs. How to handle user growth or feature additions?]
    *   **(Optional) Other Goals**: [e.g., Performance, Security, Reliability, Rapid Iteration]
*   **High-Level Architecture Diagram (Example: Frontend-Backend Separation)**: [Draw a concise architecture diagram showing core components and their main interactions. Mermaid is recommended.]

        D -- "Result" --> C
        C -- "API Response" --> B
        B -- "Updates State" --> A
    ```
*   **[Optional] Key Architectural Decisions**: [Document important architectural choices and their rationale, e.g., Why choose frontend-backend separation? Why choose a specific framework?]

### 2.2 Documentation Ecosystem
*   **Purpose**: To guide development and maintenance work clearly and efficiently, we use several types of documents, each with a specific role:
    *   **Product Requirement Documents (PRD - Version & Story)**: Define "why we are building" (background, goals) and "what to build" (user stories, scope, acceptance criteria). Located in `docs/product/prd/`.
    *   **Development Guidelines (This Document)**: Define "how to build" (technical standards, architectural principles, coding standards, workflow).
    *   **Feature Docs**: Describe "what features the system has" and "where the key implementations are" (functional module breakdown, code entry points, exposed interfaces). Located in `docs/product/features/`.
    *   **Devlogs**: Record the "development process" (task execution steps, problems encountered, decision records). Located in `docs/product/prd/[prd-version]/devlogs/` and `.cursor/devlogs/`.
*   **Relationship**: These documents complement each other and together form the project's knowledge base. Relevant documents should be consulted, referenced, and maintained as needed during development.

### 2.3 Version Control & Git Workflow
[Define the team's version control process.]
*   **Branching Strategy**: [Specify the branching model, e.g., GitFlow (main, develop, feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*), GitHub Flow (main, feature/*), or a project-specific simplified flow. Which branch is stable? Where are new features/fixes developed?]
*   **Commit Message Convention**: [e.g., Enforce adherence to the Conventional Commits specification (`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`) to facilitate Change Log generation and understanding of commit history.]
*   **Code Review Requirements**: [Is a Code Review required before merging into key branches (e.g., main, develop)? How many reviewers are needed? What are the key points of the review? Who is responsible for reviewing?]
*   **Pre-commit Checks**: [What checks must developers run locally before committing? (e.g., Linting, Formatting, Tests)]

### 2.4 API Interaction & Contract
[Define standards for API design and maintenance between frontend, backend, or other services.]
*   **API Design Style**: [e.g., RESTful API (adhering to standard HTTP methods and status codes), GraphQL].
*   **API Documentation Standard**:
    *   How to define and maintain API documentation? [e.g., Mandate using OpenAPI (Swagger) with auto-generation of `openapi.json` from the backend framework, using a Postman Collection, or maintaining a GraphQL Schema.]
    *   What information should the documentation include? [Path, method, parameters, request/response body examples, error codes, etc.].
*   **Frontend-Backend Type Synchronization Mechanism**: [How to ensure data structures are consistent between frontend and backend?]
    *   **Strongly Recommended**: Use code generation tools ([e.g., openapi-typescript-codegen, GraphQL Code Generator]) to automatically generate frontend type definitions based on the API specification.
    *   **Forbidden**: Manually writing/synchronizing API type definitions.
    *   The project should include corresponding generation scripts ([e.g., `npm run gen:types`]) and integrate them into the development process.
*   **API Versioning**: [How are API versions managed? e.g., URL path versioning (/v1/, /v2/), Header versioning, or no explicit versioning for now?]

### 2.5 General Coding Standards
[Basic coding rules applicable to all code in the project.]

*   **Naming Conventions**: [Define general naming conventions covering files, directories, constants, etc. Language/framework-specific naming conventions can be detailed in their respective sections.]
*   **Commenting Standards**:
    *   **Principle**: [When are comments necessary? (e.g., to explain complex logic, algorithms, workarounds, important decision rationale). What kind of comments to avoid? (e.g., restating the code)].
    *   **TODO/FIXME**: [Define a standard format and handling process (`// TODO: [Description] (@owner optional)`).]
*   **Code Style & Formatting Tools**: [Key to ensuring consistency.]
    *   **Mandatory Use**: [Specify the code formatting tools (e.g., Prettier, Black, gofmt) and linters (e.g., ESLint, Ruff, Checkstyle, RuboCop) used in the project.]
    *   **Configuration Files**: [Configuration files (e.g., `.prettierrc`, `pyproject.toml`, `.eslintrc.json`) should be under version control.]
    *   **CI Integration**: [Is code style enforced in the CI pipeline?].

### 2.6 Error Handling Principles
[Define the general strategy for error handling.]
*   **Error Classification & Definition**: [How to distinguish between different types of errors? (e.g., user input errors, business logic errors, third-party service errors, internal system errors). Is there a unified error code or error object structure?].
*   **Error Propagation**: [How are errors passed between different layers/services? (e.g., throwing specific exceptions, returning a Result object containing error information)].
*   **Basic Logging Requirements**: [All uncaught or critical errors should be logged. What information should logs contain for easy troubleshooting? (Trace ID, timestamp, error details, context)].
*   **Sensitive Information Handling**: [Emphasize not exposing sensitive data in error messages and logs].

### 2.7 Testing Strategy Principles
[Define the basic approach and goals for testing.]
*   **Testing Philosophy**: [e.g., Follow the Testing Pyramid (or Diamond/Honeycomb), clarifying the investment ratio and focus for each type of test. Is TDD/BDD applicable?].
*   **Test Type Definitions**: [Clearly define the meaning and boundaries of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests in the project.]
    *   **Unit Tests**: [Test goal? (e.g., logic of a single function, class, module). Are dependencies mocked?].
    *   **Integration Tests**: [Test goal? (e.g., interaction between modules, interaction with mocked external services, API endpoints)].
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: [Test goal? (e.g., simulating real user scenarios, covering critical business flows). Manual or automated?].
*   **Test Coverage**: [Is there a target? How is it measured? Emphasize a rational view of coverage numbers].

### 2.8 Dependency Management

### 3.2 State Management Strategy
[Define the specific approach to frontend state management. Consider: How is local UI state managed? Is there much cross-component shared state? Is a global solution needed? How is asynchronous operation state handled? What is a pragmatic choice for the current project phase?]
*   **Local State**: [e.g., Prefer using the framework's built-in mechanisms (`useState`, `ref`)].
*   **Shared State**: [e.g., Use Context API/Props Drilling for simple scenarios, introduce Zustand/Redux/Pinia for complex ones]. Clarify selection criteria.
*   **Async State**: [e.g., Encapsulate in custom Hooks or Services, manage loading/error/data states using `useState`/`useReducer` or a dedicated library (TanStack Query)].

### 3.3 Component Design & Organization
[How to build and organize frontend components.]
*   **Componentization Principles**: [e.g., Follow Single Responsibility Principle, keep components small and focused, distinguish between container/logic components and presentational/pure components, props design principles].
*   **Reusable Component Library**:
    *   **Strategy**: [Where to put generic UI components? (e.g., `src/components`) Where to put feature-related components? (e.g., `src/features/[featureName]/components`)].
    *   **Tooling**: [Do you use Storybook or similar tools for component development, documentation, and visual testing?].
