# Tooling & Editor Technical Debt Backlog

-   [ ] **Enhance Monaco Linting:** Monaco Editor's built-in linting has limited support for non-JS/TS languages and certain JS syntax errors. **(Updated by 2025-05-27 - Refactor Lint and Add Debug Mode)** This development removed the basic real-time linting feature, making this technical debt more explicit. If front-end linting is needed in the future, integrating a more powerful linter or Language Server should be considered.
-   [ ] **Editor State Reset:** Currently, when switching problems, only `editorRef.setValue()` is used to update the content, without explicitly clearing the undo/redo stack. Although the impact is minor for now, it could lead to a user undoing back to the state of the previous problem. In the future, researching and calling the Monaco API to implement a more thorough state reset can be explored.
